    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Quantitative Biomedical Sciences Program at Dartmouthâ€™s Geisel School of Medicine, 
      working under Dr. Nicholas Jacobson in the AI and Mental Health: Innovation in Technology Guided Healthcare (AIM HIGH) laboratory. 
      I graduated from Boston College with a Bachelors of Science in Biology, and worked at Massachusetts General Hospital in the 
      Pediatric Neurosurgery department prior to joining Dartmouth. Currently, my primary research interest is leveraging both deep learning 
      and traditional machine learning approahces with passively collected information (e.g., physical activity) to predict mental health-related 
      outcomes and symptomatology.
